# MERN Stack Basics with Postman and MongoDB

Welcome to the MERN Stack Basics project! This project is designed to provide a hands-on introduction to the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, with a special focus on utilizing the Postman application for API development and MongoDB as the chosen database.

## Overview

The MERN stack is a powerful and popular stack for building modern web applications. This project aims to guide you through the fundamental concepts of each technology in the stack, helping you understand how they work together to create a seamless full-stack development experience.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. MongoDB is used to persistently store and retrieve data in the backend.

- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building robust and scalable APIs.

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is used for building the frontend components of our application.

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. Node.js is used as the backend runtime in this stack.

- **Postman:** A collaborative platform for API development that simplifies the process of creating, testing, and documenting APIs. Postman is utilized to interact with and test the APIs developed in the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-stack-basics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mern-stack-basics
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install

   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the MongoDB server.

5. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   npm start
   ```

6. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm start
   ```

7. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## API Testing with Postman

Explore and test the APIs using the Postman application. Import the provided Postman collection (`mern-stack-basics.postman_collection.json`) to quickly get started with testing various API endpoints.
